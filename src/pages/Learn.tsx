            <p>
              Colorado uses a preference point system combined with a weighted draw to allocate limited hunting licenses for deer, elk, antelope, and other big game species. Not all units and seasons require a draw - some tags are available over-the-counter (OTC).
            </p>
            <p>
              The draw system ensures fair distribution of limited tags while giving hunters who have been applying longer a better chance of drawing.

              <strong>What are preference points?</strong> Preference points are accumulated each year you apply for a draw license but don't draw a tag. The more points you have, the better your odds in future draws.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>How do they work?</strong> Each preference point gives you an additional entry in the draw. If you have 5 preference points, your name goes in the hat 6 times (your initial application plus 5 bonus entries).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Buying points:</strong> You can also purchase preference points without applying for a specific hunt. This allows you to build points for future years without competing in the current draw.

              <strong>Early Spring (March-April):</strong> Application period opens. Research units, check draw odds from previous years, and submit your applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Late Spring (May-June):</strong> The draw takes place. Results are typically released in late May or early June.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Summer:</strong> Successful applicants receive their licenses. Plan your hunt, scout your unit, and prepare.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Fall:</strong> Hunting seasons run from late August through November depending on species and weapon type.

              <strong>First Choice:</strong> Your first choice should be the unit you most want to hunt. This is your primary application and typically has the best chance of drawing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Second Choice:</strong> Choose a unit with better odds as a backup. If you don't draw your first choice, you'll be entered in the second choice draw.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Weighted vs. Preference-Only Units:</strong> Some premium units are "preference point only" meaning all tags go to the applicants with the most points. Most units use the weighted system where you still have a chance even with fewer points.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Building Points:</strong> Many hunters build points for several years before applying for premium units with low draw odds. Use Tag Season's filters to find which units match your current point level.

              <strong>Resident vs. Non-Resident:</strong> Colorado residents get a larger percentage of tags (typically 65-80% depending on species). Non-residents compete for the remaining allocation.

            <p>
              <strong>Adult vs. Youth:</strong> Youth hunters (under 18) have separate draws with generally better odds for many units.

              <strong>Landowner Tags:</strong> Private landowners with qualifying properties can receive preference for tags in their area or transferable vouchers.
